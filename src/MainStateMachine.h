 * so all you need to do to add a new state is to first:
 * Add a new state to the StateID enum.
 * Then create a new state function:
 `
    void idleState(struct State* currState) {
        //if we recieve the startcar event we switch to slave mode
        if (currState->currentEvent == StartCar) {
            currentState->id = Slave;
        }
    }
 `
 * Finally we need to register the new state which we can do like this:
 `
    registerNewState(Idle, &idleState);
 `
 * this registerNewState function has to be called in the setup function
